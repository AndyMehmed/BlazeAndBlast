1. When the folder has been unzipped, doubleclick the index.html file to play. (Use a JavaScript supported webbrowser)
2. When the game has been started you are presented with instructions on how to play.
- WASD to move the player.
- Use the mouse to aim and left-click to shoot.
- Press E to open doors and advance to the next level.
3. Press the "Start Game" button at the bottom of the screen in order to start playing.

Info:
The goal is to advance through the levels by killing the monsters and finding the door at the end of each map.

Note that the throwing stars being used to kill enemies has a delay but can be shot as soon as the last throwing star is gone, meaning the closer the enemy is, the more often you can throw the stars.

If any bugs or glitches occur like the player gets outside the map or the screen is pitch black, reset the game by pressing F5 or the refresh button on the browser.
